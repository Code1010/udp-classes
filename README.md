This repo stores some classes for UDP servers and UDP clients. It's pretty
simple, really.

Eventually, I will use these in another project for a networking thing
in AP Computer science.

(It will likely be in another repo)

	I will no longer be working on this project because my school has AP Isolation and I don't feel like lugging around a router all day...This project will be replaced by a game called Vengeance
